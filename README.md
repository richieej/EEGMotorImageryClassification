# EEGMotorImageryClassification
Deep Learning classification of motor imagery through EEG measurements and data.

Specifically, through use of convolution neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN): long-short-term-memory (LSTM) and gated-recurrent-unit (GRU) in particular. We are able to achieve 73% model accuracy with a model that incorporates both CNN and LSTM, allowing us to learn temporal and spatial features of the data.
